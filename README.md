#JOB POCKET

##Description
This app, will allow job seekers to store job postings off of any site with an url that doesn't require a login to view. As a job seeker, you may come across various job postings that you would like to save and view at a later time. This app will allow you to paste that url into your Job Pocket App. The app will then save the url to your personal list. In addition this app will have a recommendation newsfeed section based off scraping job postings from craigslist. For the recommendation section you will have the ability to narrow down the search results by entering key words that you would like to add or avoid.
